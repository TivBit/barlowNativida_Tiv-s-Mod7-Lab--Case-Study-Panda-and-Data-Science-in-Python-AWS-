About Notebook
Lab 5: Analyze Data with Amazon Sagemaker, Jupyter Notebooks and Bokeh

Bug Report:

Initally, after loading code, I experienced "Keyword errors", but was able to debug using the resources that Bokeh have to offer with their sample codes.  I saved code to "list.html", and "taxidata.html" files as required, but also went ahead and saved those code cells to the Notebook so that it would load within the notebook, as well. It appears all cells have run successfully without error.

New Note:

I was able to get the Notebook to run perfectly in Jupyter Notebook in the conda3 environment, but when I uploaded the files to GitHub, the Notebook it's self populates, but the graphs get stuck on "Loading BokehJS ...".  Not sure if I am missing a requirement in the requirement.txt file, but doesn't seem to want to stop loading.
