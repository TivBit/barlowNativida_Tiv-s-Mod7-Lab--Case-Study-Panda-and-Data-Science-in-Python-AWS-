About:
Lab 5: Analyze Data with Amazon Sagemaker, Jupyter Notebooks and Bokeh

Bug Report:

Initally, after loading code, I experienced "Keyword errors", but was able to debug using the resources that Bokeh have to offer with their sample codes.  I saved code to "list.html", and "taxidata.html" files as required, but also went ahead and saved those code cells to the Notebook so that it would load within the notebook, as well. It appears all cells have run successfully without error.  ~ T.Barlow (SDEV 220 Student) | C.Francis (SDEV 220 Instuctor)
